Subject:      CTAN Submission -- Fix for Bakoma fonts

I have uploaded a file newbakoma.tar.gz to ftp.tex.ac.uk:/incoming.

It contains the files

cmbsy10.pfb   cmbsy8.pfb    cmsy5.pfb     cmsy8.pfb
cmbsy6.pfb    cmbsy9.pfb    cmsy6.pfb     cmsy9.pfb
cmbsy7.pfb    cmsy10.pfb    cmsy7.pfb

which unpack into a directory newbakoma/.

It's purpose is to provide a simple solution to a known
problem--square roots when using the Bakoma fonts get chopped off at
the knees.  I did nothing particularly original--I just followed the
advice from the following news article (found using Deja News):

The unchopped fonts referred to seem to have fallen off the face of
CTAN, so I figured I'd provide corrected ones.

I took the -999 literally; somebody who actually knows what they're
doing could probably make a tighter bounding box.  Note that you don't
even need a hex editor to do this--I just edited the 'FontBBox'
comment, which is in plaintext.  Maybe I should have changed something
else, but this seemed to be sufficient to get things working.  Let me
reiterate I have no clue what I'm doing--I just applied a simple fix
which seems to work.  I'd welcome anyone who knows what's going on to
provide a better solution.

I would suggest replacing Basil's version of these fonts in
fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/pfb with the corrected files, and renaming
his to <file>.orig.

Note I've only fixed the pfb files; the other formats should probably
be updated as well (?), but I lack the facilities and knowledge to do
so.

A big thanks to Basil for making these things in the first place, Deja
News for preventing information from falling off the end of the net,
and the CTAN folks for organizing all the TeX stuff...
