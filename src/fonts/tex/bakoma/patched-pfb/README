This directory contains a set of (unofficial) patches to the BaKoMa
symbol fonts, which provide a simple solution to a known problem --
square roots when using the Bakoma fonts get chopped off at the knees.

Their author is J. Scott Berg, and a copy of his announcement of the
files is contained in file NOTICE in this directory.
